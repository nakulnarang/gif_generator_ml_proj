# Meme Video Generation with AnimateDiff and ModelscopeT2V

This project demonstrates the generation of meme videos and GIFs using two pre-trained models from Hugging Face: AnimateDiff and ModelscopeT2V. These models convert text prompts into videos, making it easier to create humorous and contextually relevant meme content.

## What This Project Does

- Utilizes text-to-video models to generate meme videos.
- Compares the output of the two models using Mean Squared Error (MSE) to evaluate the smoothness and consistency of the videos.

## How to Run

1. Download the Jupyter notebook from this repository.
2. Open the notebook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
3. Run the notebook cells to generate and evaluate meme videos.
